# Typing Speed Game

This game tests the typing speed of user, it can 
also be used to improve typing speed,or can be played for fun.

## Technologies used
Python

## CS fundamentals
In this project some CS Fundamental Concepts are used like variable , function ,If and else statement,loops.

3 different functions are used for calculating speed, elapsed time, and the errors. this project shows the use of function, also defining a function and calling it (with parameters). 

A for loop is used in the tperror function, that is used for calculating errors, and it contains if , else statements inside it.

## Python
In this project,some basic concepts of python programming language is used. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 

This project also uses The Python time module. The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. here, we use it to get start time and end time,and hence the elapsed time, and by using this we calculated the speed.
